# Player Tutorials

## Introduction
Player Tutorials is a Minecraft Plugin which helps people create advanced, lag free tutorials for their server.
It is highly configurable and offers a lot of possibilities. Multiple players are also able to join a tutorial.

## Mechanic
A staff member is able to create new tutorials via the command /tutorials create name. Each Tutorial has at least
one so called Area. An Area is basically a selection the staff member makes which will then act as the arena and the
tutorial playground. Each Area can have it's own set of so called Tasks. There are many task variations like Teleport
Task or Command Task. You can define whether the player has to execute a command or let the console execute one.
With that system you are able to create highly customizable tutorials for players with big arenas which will be copied
and pasted in a whitespace that the server staff defines.
